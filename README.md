# CP stands for Competitive Programming. #

I'll upload some necessary algorithms needed for competitive programming :)

# Proposed Practice Methodology: #
1. First choose an algorithm. Search for problems related to that algorithm and solve as many problems as you can until you think mastered it. Write code from scratch for every problems. 
2. I'll create folders for each topic I guess (DP, Graph, etc). And all the related algorithms will go to different folders under that folder and all the related problems that I will solve will be there.
3. After mastering an algorithm, move to next algorithm of that topic.
4. Lets see how this method works. :)
