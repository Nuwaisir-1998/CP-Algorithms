# 1.
If you are given two operations and you want to minimize the number of
operations, then think about if doing one operation before the
other always improves or not. Like taking operation 2 before 1
always. So, then the operation sequence will be like 2,2,2,1,1,1,1.

# 2.
If you are given some operations and you want to minimize or maximize some
value, then you can think of doing one kind of operation to a particular
set of numbers all at once, then the remaining operations on the other set
of numbers all at once. You can do a brute foce.
