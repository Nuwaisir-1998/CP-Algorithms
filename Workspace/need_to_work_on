1. When I find an idea, and after some time find out that this idea
doesn't work for some cases, maybe I don't think much about why this
idea fails. That's a big problem.

2. For this (https://codeforces.com/contest/1486/problem/D) problem,
when I was traversing the array in the check function, I totally forgot
to check the prefix of the array when I was searching for a subarray
having positive sum. So, always remember to check whether you are checking
the prefix or suffix as well (Corner cases ?). Found the bug by doing stress
test over the author's solution :(
